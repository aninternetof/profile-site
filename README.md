# profile-site
Personal profile website using Zurb Foundation 5. Version 0.0.1 (i.e., I am still learning).

## Foundation
Foundation is great. [Check out of its features.] (http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/kitchen_sink.html)

## Single page parallax design
This site is centered around a single-page design, with a banner header and full-width slides denoting sections. The background images have parallax scrolling.

## Animated scrolling
I used JS animated scrolling from section to section.  [Here is the tutorial I used to learn how.](http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/create-scrolling-parallax-website/)

## Modals
One of the best features of Foundation is their modal pop-ups. I use those to direct the user to more detailed content without getting them far away from the main page.

## Content Included
I included all of my background images, so you have the whole site out of the box.
