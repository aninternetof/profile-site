    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>I work as an electrical engineer at a small electronic product
    design firm in Indianapolis. We take ideas from napkin sketches 
    to manufacturable products for everyone from tiny start-ups to 
    massive corporations. </p>
    <p>I live in downtown Indianapolis with my incredible wife Molly 
    and our puppy. If you come visit us, we'll show you our favorite
    hot sauce place. </p>
