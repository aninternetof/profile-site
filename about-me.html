  <p> IMPORTED CONTENT! I work as an electrical engineer at a small electronic product
  design firm in Indianapolis. We take ideas from napkin sketches 
  to manufacturable products for everyone from tiny start-ups to 
  massive corporations. </p>
  <p>I live in downtown Indianapolis with my incredible wife Molly 
  and our puppy. If you come visit us, we'll show you our favorite
  hot sauce place. </p>
